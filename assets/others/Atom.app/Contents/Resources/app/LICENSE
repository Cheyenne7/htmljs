Source Text:

ansi.js
=========
### Advanced ANSI formatting tool for Node.js

`ansi.js` is a module for Node.js that provides an easy-to-use API for
writing ANSI escape codes to `Stream` instances. ANSI escape codes are used to do
fancy things in a terminal window, like render text in colors, delete characters,
lines, the entire window, or hide and show the cursor, and lots more!

The code for the example in the screenshot above can be found in the
`examples/imgcat` directory.

#### Features:

 * 256 color support for the terminal!
 * Make a beep sound from your terminal!
 * Works with *any* writable `Stream` instance.
 * Allows you to move the cursor anywhere on the terminal window.
 * Allows you to delete existing contents from the terminal window.
 * Allows you to hide and show the cursor.
 * Converts CSS color codes and RGB values into ANSI escape codes.
 * Low-level; you are in control of when escape codes are used, it's not abstracted.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install ansi
```


Example
-------

``` js
var ansi = require('ansi')
  , cursor = ansi(process.stdout)

// You can chain your calls forever:
cursor
  .red()                 // Set font color to red
  .bg.grey()             // Set background color to grey
  .write('Hello World!') // Write 'Hello World!' to stdout
  .bg.reset()            // Reset the bgcolor before writing the trailing \n,
                         //      to avoid Terminal glitches
  .write('\n')           // And a final \n to wrap things up

// Rendering modes are persistent:
cursor.hex('#660000').bold().underline()

// You can use the regular logging functions, text will be green
console.log('This is blood red, bold text')

// To reset just the foreground color:
cursor.fg.reset()

console.log('This will still be bold')

// Clean up after yourself!
cursor.reset()
```

Package: asn1@0.1.11
License: MIT
License Source: README
Source Text:

node-asn1 is a library for encoding and decoding ASN.1 datatypes in pure JS.
Currently BER encoding is supported; at some point I'll likely have to do DER.

## Usage

Mostly, if you're *actually* needing to read and write ASN.1, you probably don't
need this readme to explain what and why.  If you have no idea what ASN.1 is,
see this: ftp://ftp.rsa.com/pub/pkcs/ascii/layman.asc

The source is pretty much self-explanatory, and has read/write methods for the
common types out there.

### Decoding

The following reads an ASN.1 sequence with a boolean.

    var Ber = require('asn1').Ber;

    var reader = new Ber.Reader(new Buffer([0x30, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0xff]));

    reader.readSequence();
    console.log('Sequence len: ' + reader.length);
    if (reader.peek() === Ber.Boolean)
      console.log(reader.readBoolean());

### Encoding

The following generates the same payload as above.

    var Ber = require('asn1').Ber;

    var writer = new Ber.Writer();

    writer.startSequence();
    writer.writeBoolean(true);
    writer.endSequence();

    console.log(writer.buffer);

## Installation

    npm install asn1

## License

MIT.

## Bugs

Package: assert-plus@0.1.2
License: MIT
License Source: README
Source Text:

# node-assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
	    assert.object(options, 'options');
		assert.number(options.id, 'options.id);
		assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
		assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
		assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
		assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
		callback(null, {});
    }

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
	at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
	at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
	at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
	at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
	at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
	at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
	at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
	at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

    function test(foo) {
	    assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

    function test(foo) {
	    assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.arrayOfBool
* assert.arrayOfFunc
* assert.arrayOfNumber
* assert.arrayOfObject
* assert.arrayOfString
* assert.optionalBool
* assert.optionalBuffer
* assert.optionalFunc
* assert.optionalNumber
* assert.optionalObject
* assert.optionalString
* assert.optionalArrayOfBool
* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc
* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber
* assert.optionalArrayOfObject
* assert.optionalArrayOfString
* assert.AssertionError
* assert.fail
* assert.ok
* assert.equal
* assert.notEqual
* assert.deepEqual
* assert.notDeepEqual
* assert.strictEqual
* assert.notStrictEqual
* assert.throws
* assert.doesNotThrow
* assert.ifError

# Installation

    npm install assert-plus

node-bindings
=============
### Helper module for loading your native module's .node file

This is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules.
It is basically the "swiss army knife" of `require()`ing your native module's
`.node` file.

Throughout the course of Node's native addon history, addons have ended up being
compiled in a variety of different places, depending on which build tool and which
version of node was used. To make matters worse, now the _gyp_ build tool can
produce either a _Release_ or _Debug_ build, each being built into different
locations.

This module checks _all_ the possible locations that a native addon would be built
at, and returns the first one that loads successfully.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install bindings
```

Or add it to the `"dependencies"` section of your _package.json_ file.


Example
-------

`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform
and architecture is as simple as:

``` js
var bindings = require('bindings')('binding.node')

// Use your bindings defined in your C files
bindings.your_c_function()
```


Nice Error Output
-----------------

When the `.node` file could not be loaded, `node-bindings` throws an Error with
a nice error message telling you exactly what was tried. You can also check the
`err.tries` Array property.

```
Error: Could not load the bindings file. Tried:

# cheerio [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/MatthewMueller/cheerio.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/MatthewMueller/cheerio)

Fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server.

## Introduction
Teach your server HTML.

```js
var cheerio = require('cheerio'),
    $ = cheerio.load('<h2 class="title">Hello world</h2>');

$('h2.title').text('Hello there!');
$('h2').addClass('welcome');

$.html();
//=> <h2 class="title welcome">Hello there!</h2>
```

## Installation
`npm install cheerio`

## Features
__&#10084; Familiar syntax:__
Cheerio implements a subset of core jQuery. Cheerio removes all the DOM inconsistencies and browser cruft from the jQuery library, revealing its truly gorgeous API.

__&#991; Blazingly fast:__
Cheerio works with a very simple, consistent DOM model. As a result parsing, manipulating, and rendering are incredibly efficient. Preliminary end-to-end benchmarks suggest that cheerio is about __8x__ faster than JSDOM.

__&#10049; Insanely flexible:__
Cheerio wraps around @FB55's forgiving htmlparser. Cheerio can parse nearly any HTML or XML document.

## What about JSDOM?
I wrote cheerio because I found myself increasingly frustrated with JSDOM. For me, there were three main sticking points that I kept running into again and again:

__&#8226; JSDOM's built-in parser is too strict:__
  JSDOM's bundled HTML parser cannot handle many popular sites out there today.

__&#8226; JSDOM is too slow:__
Parsing big websites with JSDOM has a noticeable delay.

__&#8226; JSDOM feels too heavy:__
The goal of JSDOM is to provide an identical DOM environment as what we see in the browser. I never really needed all this, I just wanted a simple, familiar way to do HTML manipulation.

## When I would use JSDOM

Cheerio will not solve all your problems. I would still use JSDOM if I needed to work in a browser-like environment on the server, particularly if I wanted to automate functional tests.

## API

### Markup example we'll be using:

```html
<ul id="fruits">
  <li class="apple">Apple</li>
  <li class="orange">Orange</li>
  <li class="pear">Pear</li>
</ul>
```

This is the HTML markup we will be using in all of the API examples.

### Loading
First you need to load in the HTML. This step in jQuery is implicit, since jQuery operates on the one, baked-in DOM. With Cheerio, we need to pass in the HTML document.

This is the _preferred_ method:

```js
var cheerio = require('cheerio'),
    $ = cheerio.load('<ul id="fruits">...</ul>');
```

Optionally, you can also load in the HTML by passing the string as the context:

```js
$ = require('cheerio');
$('ul', '<ul id="fruits">...</ul>');
```

Or as the root:

```js
$ = require('cheerio');
$('li', 'ul', '<ul id="fruits">...</ul>');
```

You can also pass an extra object to `.load()` if you need to modify any
of the default parsing options:

```js
$ = cheerio.load('<ul id="fruits">...</ul>', {
    normalizeWhitespace: true,
    xmlMode: true
});
```

These parsing options are taken directly from htmlparser, therefore any options that can be used in htmlparser
are valid in cheerio as well. The default options are:

```js
{
    normalizeWhitespace: false,
    xmlMode: false,
    lowerCaseTags: false
}
```

For a list of options and their effects, see [this](https://github.com/fb55/DomHandler) and
[this](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options).

### Selectors

Cheerio's selector implementation is nearly identical to jQuery's, so the API is very similar.

#### $( selector, [context], [root] )
`selector` searches within the `context` scope which searches within the `root` scope. `selector` and `context` can be an string expression, DOM Element, array of DOM elements, or cheerio object. `root` is typically the HTML document string.

This selector method is the starting point for traversing and manipulating the document. Like jQuery, it's the primary method for selecting elements in the document, but unlike jQuery it's built on top of the CSSSelect library, which implements most of the Sizzle selectors.

```js
$('.apple', '#fruits').text()
//=> Apple

$('ul .pear').attr('class')
//=> pear

$('li[class=orange]').html()
//=> <li class="orange">Orange</li>
```

### Attributes
Methods for getting and modifying attributes.

#### .attr( name, value )
Method for getting and setting attributes. Gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set. If you set an attribute's value to `null`, you remove that attribute. You may also pass a `map` and `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('ul').attr('id')
//=> fruits

$('.apple').attr('id', 'favorite').html()
//=> <li class="apple" id="favorite">Apple</li>
```

> See http://api.jquery.com/attr/ for more information

#### .data( name, value )
Method for getting and setting data attributes. Gets or sets the data attribute value for only the first element in the matched set.

```js
$('<div data-apple-color="red"></div>').data()
//=> { appleColor: 'red' }

$('<div data-apple-color="red"></div>').data('data-apple-color')
//=> 'red'

var apple = $('.apple').data('kind', 'mac')
apple.data('kind')
//=> 'mac'
```

> See http://api.jquery.com/data/ for more information

#### .val( [value] )
Method for getting and setting the value of input, select, and textarea. Note: Support for `map`, and `function` has not been added yet.

    $('input[type="text"]').val()
    => input_text

    $('input[type="text"]').val('test').html()
    => <input type="text" value="test"/>


#### .removeAttr( name )
Method for removing attributes by `name`.

```js
$('.pear').removeAttr('class').html()
//=> <li>Pear</li>
```

#### .hasClass( className )
Check to see if *any* of the matched elements have the given `className`.

```js
$('.pear').hasClass('pear')
//=> true

$('apple').hasClass('fruit')
//=> false

$('li').hasClass('pear')
//=> true
```

#### .addClass( className )
Adds class(es) to all of the matched elements. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('.pear').addClass('fruit').html()
//=> <li class="pear fruit">Pear</li>

$('.apple').addClass('fruit red').html()
//=> <li class="apple fruit red">Apple</li>
```

> See http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ for more information.

#### .removeClass( [className] )
Removes one or more space-separated classes from the selected elements. If no `className` is defined, all classes will be removed. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('.pear').removeClass('pear').html()
//=> <li class="">Pear</li>

$('.apple').addClass('red').removeClass().html()
//=> <li class="">Apple</li>
```

> See http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ for more information.

#### .toggleClass( className, [switch] )
Add or remove class(es) from the matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.

```js
$('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red').html()
//=> <li class="apple fruit red">Apple</li>

$('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red', true).html()
//=> <li class="apple green fruit red">Apple</li>
```

> See http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ for more information.

#### .is( selector )
#### .is( element )
#### .is( selection )
#### .is( function(index) )
Checks the current list of elements and returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match the selector. If using an element or Cheerio selection, returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match. If using a predicate function, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.


### Traversing

#### .find(selector)
Get a set of descendants filtered by `selector` of each element in the current set of matched elements.

```js
$('#fruits').find('li').length
//=> 3
```

#### .parent([selector])
Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

```js
$('.pear').parent().attr('id')
//=> fruits
```

#### .parents([selector])
Get a set of parents filtered by `selector` of each element in the current set of match elements.
```js
$('.orange').parents().length
// => 2
$('.orange').parents('#fruits').length
// => 1
```

#### .closest(selector)
For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.

```js
$('.orange').closest()
// => []
$('.orange').closest('.apple')
// => []
$('.orange').closest('li')
// => [<li class="orange">Orange</li>]
$('.orange').closest('#fruits')
// => [<ul id="fruits"> ... </ul>]
```

#### .next()
Gets the next sibling of the first selected element.

```js
$('.apple').next().hasClass('orange')
//=> true
```

#### .nextAll()
Gets all the following siblings of the first selected element.

```js
$('.apple').nextAll()
//=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>, <li class="pear">Pear</li>]
```

#### .nextUntil()
Gets all the following siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector.

```js
$('.apple').nextUntil('.pear')
//=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>]
```

#### .prev()
Gets the previous sibling of the first selected element.

```js
$('.orange').prev().hasClass('apple')
//=> true
```

#### .prevAll()
Gets all the preceding siblings of the first selected element.

```js
$('.pear').prevAll()
//=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>, <li class="apple">Apple</li>]
```

#### .prevUntil()
Gets all the preceding siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector.

```js
$('.pear').prevUntil('.apple')
//=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>]
```

#### .slice( start, [end] )
Gets the elements matching the specified range

```js
$('li').slice(1).eq(0).text()
//=> 'Orange'

$('li').slice(1, 2).length
//=> 1
```

#### .siblings( selector )
Gets the first selected element's siblings, excluding itself.

```js
$('.pear').siblings().length
//=> 2

$('.pear').siblings('.orange').length
//=> 1

```

#### .children( selector )
Gets the children of the first selected element.

```js
$('#fruits').children().length
//=> 3

$('#fruits').children('.pear').text()
//=> Pear
```

#### .contents()
Gets the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes.

```js
$('#fruits').contents().length
//=> 3
```

#### .each( function(index, element) )
Iterates over a cheerio object, executing a function for each matched element. When the callback is fired, the function is fired in the context of the DOM element, so `this` refers to the current element, which is equivalent to the function parameter `element`. To break out of the `each` loop early, return with `false`.

```js
var fruits = [];

$('li').each(function(i, elem) {
  fruits[i] = $(this).text();
});

fruits.join(', ');
//=> Apple, Orange, Pear
```

#### .map( function(index, element) )
Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new Cheerio object containing the return values. The function can return an individual data item or an array of data items to be inserted into the resulting set. If an array is returned, the elements inside the array are inserted into the set. If the function returns null or undefined, no element will be inserted.

```js
$('li').map(function(i, el) {
  // this === el
  return $('<div>').text($(this).text());
}).html();
//=> <div>apple</div><div>orange</div><div>pear</div>
```

#### .filter( selector ) <br /> .filter( selection ) <br /> .filter( element ) <br /> .filter( function(index) )

Iterates over a cheerio object, reducing the set of selector elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. When a Cheerio selection is specified, return only the elements contained in that selection. When an element is specified, return only that element (if it is contained in the original selection). If using the function method, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.

Selector:

```js
$('li').filter('.orange').attr('class');
//=> orange
```

Function:

```js
$('li').filter(function(i, el) {
  // this === el
  return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange';
}).attr('class')
//=> orange
```

#### .first()
Will select the first element of a cheerio object

```js
$('#fruits').children().first().text()
//=> Apple
```

#### .last()
Will select the last element of a cheerio object

```js
$('#fruits').children().last().text()
//=> Pear
```

#### .eq( i )
Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. Use `.eq(-i)` to count backwards from the last selected element.

```js
$('li').eq(0).text()
//=> Apple

$('li').eq(-1).text()
//=> Pear
```

#### .end()
End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.

```js
$('li').eq(0).end().length
//=> 3
```

### Manipulation
Methods for modifying the DOM structure.

#### .append( content, [content, ...] )
Inserts content as the *last* child of each of the selected elements.

```js
$('ul').append('<li class="plum">Plum</li>')
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits">
//      <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//      <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//      <li class="pear">Pear</li>
//      <li class="plum">Plum</li>
//    </ul>
```

#### .prepend( content, [content, ...] )
Inserts content as the *first* child of each of the selected elements.

```js
$('ul').prepend('<li class="plum">Plum</li>')
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits">
//      <li class="plum">Plum</li>
//      <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//      <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//      <li class="pear">Pear</li>
//    </ul>
```

#### .after( content, [content, ...] )
Insert content next to each element in the set of matched elements.

```js
$('.apple').after('<li class="plum">Plum</li>')
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits">
//      <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//      <li class="plum">Plum</li>
//      <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//      <li class="pear">Pear</li>
//    </ul>
```

#### .before( content, [content, ...] )
Insert content previous to each element in the set of matched elements.

```js
$('.apple').before('<li class="plum">Plum</li>')
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits">
//      <li class="plum">Plum</li>
//      <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//      <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//      <li class="pear">Pear</li>
//    </ul>
```

#### .remove( [selector] )
Removes the set of matched elements from the DOM and all their children. `selector` filters the set of matched elements to be removed.

```js
$('.pear').remove()
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits">
//      <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//      <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//    </ul>
```

#### .replaceWith( content )
Replaces matched elements with `content`.

```js
var plum = $('<li class="plum">Plum</li>')
$('.pear').replaceWith(plum)
$.html()
//=> <ul id="fruits">
//     <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//     <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//     <li class="plum">Plum</li>
//   </ul>
```

#### .empty()
Empties an element, removing all it's children.

```js
$('ul').empty()
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits"></ul>
```

#### .html( [htmlString] )
Gets an html content string from the first selected element. If `htmlString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new content.

```js
$('.orange').html()
//=> Orange

$('#fruits').html('<li class="mango">Mango</li>').html()
//=> <li class="mango">Mango</li>
```

#### .text( [textString] )
Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants.. If `textString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new text content.

```js
$('.orange').text()
//=> Orange

$('ul').text()
//=>  Apple
//    Orange
//    Pear
```

#### .css( [propertName] ) <br /> .css( [ propertyNames] ) <br /> .css( [propertyName], [value] ) <br /> .css( [propertName], [function] ) <br /> .css( [properties] )

Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.

### Rendering
When you're ready to render the document, you can use the `html` utility function:

```js
$.html()
//=>  <ul id="fruits">
//      <li class="apple">Apple</li>
//      <li class="orange">Orange</li>
//      <li class="pear">Pear</li>
//    </ul>
```

If you want to return the outerHTML you can use `$.html(selector)`:

```js
$.html('.pear')
//=> <li class="pear">Pear</li>
```

By default, `html` will leave some tags open. Sometimes you may instead want to render a valid XML document. For example, you might parse the following XML snippet:

```xml
$ = cheerio.load('<media:thumbnail url="http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg" width="75" height="50" time="12:05:01.123"/>');
```

... and later want to render to XML. To do this, you can use the 'xml' utility function:

```js
$.xml()
//=>  <media:thumbnail url="http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg" width="75" height="50" time="12:05:01.123"/>
```


### Miscellaneous
DOM element methods that don't fit anywhere else

#### .toArray()
Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set, as an array.

```js
$('li').toArray()
//=> [ {...}, {...}, {...} ]
```

#### .clone() ####
Clone the cheerio object.

```js
var moreFruit = $('#fruits').clone()
```

### Utilities

#### $.root

Sometimes you need to work with the top-level root element. To query it, you can use `$.root()`.

```js
$.root().append('<ul id="vegetables"></ul>').html();
//=> <ul id="fruits">...</ul><ul id="vegetables"></ul>
```

#### $.contains( container, contained )
Checks to see if the `contained` DOM element is a descendent of the `container` DOM element.

#### $.parseHTML( data [, context ] [, keepScripts ] )
Parses a string into an array of DOM nodes. The `context` argument has no meaning for Cheerio, but it is maintained for API compatability.

## Screencasts

http://vimeo.com/31950192

> This video tutorial is a follow-up to Nettut's "How to Scrape Web Pages with Node.js and jQuery", using cheerio instead of JSDOM + jQuery. This video shows how easy it is to use cheerio and how much faster cheerio is than JSDOM + jQuery.

## Test Coverage

Cheerio has high-test coverage, you can view the report [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/MattMueller/Coverage/cheerio.html).

## Testing

To run the test suite, download the repository, then within the cheerio directory, run:

```shell
make setup
make test
```

This will download the development packages and run the test suite.

## Special Thanks

This library stands on the shoulders of some incredible developers. A special thanks to:

__&#8226; @FB55 for node-htmlparser2 & CSSSelect:__
Felix has a knack for writing speedy parsing engines. He completely re-wrote both @tautologistic's `node-htmlparser` and @harry's `node-soupselect` from the ground up, making both of them much faster and more flexible. Cheerio would not be possible without his foundational work

__&#8226; @jQuery team for jQuery:__
The core API is the best of it's class and despite dealing with all the browser inconsistencies the code base is extremely clean and easy to follow. Much of cheerio's implementation and documentation is from jQuery. Thanks guys.

__&#8226; @visionmedia:__
The style, the structure, the open-source"-ness" of this library comes from studying TJ's style and using many of his libraries. This dude consistently pumps out high-quality libraries and has always been more than willing to help or answer questions. You rock TJ.

# Commander.js

  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).

 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)

## Installation

    $ npm install commander

## Option parsing

 Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')
  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')
  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')
  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log('you ordered a pizza with:');
if (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');
if (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineapple');
if (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');
console.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);
```

 Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.

## Automated --help

 The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:

```  
 $ ./examples/pizza --help

   Usage: pizza [options]

   Options:

     -V, --version        output the version number
     -p, --peppers        Add peppers
     -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple
     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce
     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]
     -h, --help           output usage information

```

## Coercion

```js
function range(val) {
  return val.split('..').map(Number);
}

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',');
}

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .usage('[options] <file ...>')
  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)
  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)
  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)
  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)
  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log(' int: %j', program.integer);
console.log(' float: %j', program.float);
console.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);
program.range = program.range || [];
console.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);
console.log(' list: %j', program.list);
console.log(' args: %j', program.args);
```

## Custom help

 You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information
 by listening for "--help". Commander will automatically
 exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program
 does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example
 in the following executable "stuff" will not output when
 `--help` is used.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('../');

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',').map(Number);
}

program
  .version('0.0.1')
  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')
  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')
  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');

// must be before .parse() since
// node's emit() is immediate

program.on('--help', function(){
  console.log('  Examples:');
  console.log('');
  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');
  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');
  console.log('');
});

program.parse(process.argv);

console.log('stuff');
```

yielding the following help output:

```

Usage: custom-help [options]

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
  -f, --foo      enable some foo
  -b, --bar      enable some bar
  -B, --baz      enable some baz

Examples:

  $ custom-help --help
  $ custom-help -h

```

## .outputHelp()

  Output help information without exiting.

## .help()

  Output help information and exit immediately.

#emoji-images.js

Because sometimes you want to send a :heart: to someone.


## What is this?

Takes text, replaces all the texts here: http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com with an `<img>` tag containing the image.

The images are all in the [](pngs) folder. Host those somewhere, pass the URL to the function. See below:


## How to use it

```js

var string = 'a string containing emoji strings like :heart: and :trollface:';

// the emoji function takes:
// 1. The input string
// 2. The url where the png files live
// 3. (optionally) a size to specify as the height of the <img> tag.
var emojified = emoji(string, 'http://url.com/where-you-put-the-pngs-folder/', 30); 

```

It's bundled to work as a CommonJS module, AMD module or expose itself as a global as a fallback.

## install

Grab it here or on npm:

```
npm install emoji-images
```

## Why not just use https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js?

I want it all in a super simple text processing (without the CSS and DOM stuff).

Also, that solution embeds pngs as data-uri's in css documents. I don't want to do that because then I have to send all that image data to the browser even if they never get used.


## Is it ready to use?

Um... works for me™  (and in use on andbang.com)

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

1. Definitions.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# node-querystring

  query string parser for node and the browser supporting nesting, as it was removed from `0.3.x`, so this library provides the previous and commonly desired behaviour (and twice as fast). Used by [express](http://expressjs.com), [connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect) and others.

## Installation

    $ npm install qs

## Examples

```js
var qs = require('qs');

qs.parse('user[name][first]=Tobi&user[email]=tobi@learnboost.com');
// => { user: { name: { first: 'Tobi' }, email: 'tobi@learnboost.com' } }

qs.stringify({ user: { name: 'Tobi', email: 'tobi@learnboost.com' }})
// => user[name]=Tobi&user[email]=tobi%40learnboost.com
```

## Testing

Install dev dependencies:

    $ npm install -d

and execute:

    $ make test

browser:

    $ open test/browser/index.html

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[RFC6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js

![Tough Cookie](http://www.goinstant.com.s3.amazonaws.com/tough-cookie.jpg)

# Synopsis

``` javascript
var cookies = require('tough-cookie'); // note: not 'cookie', 'cookies' or 'node-cookie'
var Cookie = cookies.Cookie;
var cookie = Cookie.parse(header);
cookie.value = 'somethingdifferent';
header = cookie.toString();

var cookiejar = new cookies.CookieJar();
cookiejar.setCookie(cookie, 'http://currentdomain.example.com/path', cb);
// ...
cookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath',function(err,cookies) {
  res.headers['cookie'] = cookies.join('; ');
});
```

# Installation

It's _so_ easy!

`npm install tough-cookie`

Requires `punycode`, which should get installed automatically for you.  Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.

Why the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.

# API

cookies
=======

Functions on the module you get from `require('tough-cookie')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don't need to be "bound".

parseDate(string[,strict])
-----------------

Parse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).

formatDate(date)
----------------

Format a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).

canonicalDomain(str)
--------------------

Transforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).

domainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])
-------------------------------------------

Answers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".

The `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.

defaultPath(path)
-----------------

Given a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.

The `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node's `uri.parse()` output.

pathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)
-----------------------------

Answers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.

This is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.

parse(header[,strict=false])
----------------------------

alias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`

fromJSON(string)
----------------

alias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`

getPublicSuffix(hostname)
-------------------------

Returns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.

For example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.

For further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.

cookieCompare(a,b)
------------------

For use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.

``` javascript
var cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];
cookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);
```

permuteDomain(domain)
---------------------

Generates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.


permutePath(path)
-----------------

Generates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.

Cookie
======

Cookie.parse(header[,strict=false])
-----------------------------------

Parses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can't be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn't follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.

Here's how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:

``` javascript
if (res.headers['set-cookie'] instanceof Array)
  cookies = res.headers['set-cookie'].map(Cookie.parse);
else
  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers['set-cookie'])];
```

Cookie.fromJSON(string)
-----------------------

Convert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.

Properties
==========

  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")
  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")
  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`
  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`
  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie
  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie
  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag
  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag
  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)
               
After a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:

  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)
  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.
  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar
  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.

Construction([{options}])
------------

Receives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.

.toString()
-----------

encode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.

.cookieString()
---------------

encode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with '=').

.setExpires(String)
-------------------

sets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can't parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.

.setMaxAge(number)
-------------------

sets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.

.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])
-----------------------------

.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])
-----------------------------

expiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.

Max-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.

If Expires (`.expires`) is set, that's returned.

Otherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).

.TTL([now=Date.now()])
---------

compute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.

The "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.

.canonicalizedDoman()
---------------------

.cdomain()
----------

return the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.

.validate()
-----------

Status: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.

validates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:

``` javascript
if (cookie.validate() === true) {
  // it's tasty
} else {
  // yuck!
}
```

CookieJar
=========

Construction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])
------------

Simply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you'd like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.


Attributes
----------

  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)
                         
Since eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.

.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Attempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.

The `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:

  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks
  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren't ignored by this option.

As per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).

.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))
-------------------------------------------------

__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below
                                                
.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))
-----------------------------------------------------

Retrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.

If an error is encountered, that's passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.

The `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:

  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.
  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.
  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies
  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).
  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).

The `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.

.getCookieString(...)
---------------------

Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.

.getSetCookieStrings(...)
-------------------------

Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes an array of strings suitable for Set-Cookie headers (rather than an array of `Cookie`s) to the callback.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.

# CookieStore API

The storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.

All `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.

The Cookie store must have all of the following methods.

store.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))
---------------------------------------------------

Retrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.

Callback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).

store.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))
------------------------------------------------

Locates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.

If no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.

The resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it's OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.

As of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).

store.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))
--------------------------------

Adds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it's possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.

The `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.

Pass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.

store.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))
-------------------------------------------------

Update an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.

The `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).

Stores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn't define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.

The `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.

Pass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.

store.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))
----------------------------------------------

Remove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).

The implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn't exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.

store.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))
------------------------------------------

Removes matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.

Pass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.

# TODO

  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`
    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891
  * better tests for `validate()`?

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
